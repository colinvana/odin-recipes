        <h3>What's in it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1lb Ground Beef</li>
                <li>1 Bag frozen tater tots</li>
                <li>8oz Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
                <li>1 Chopped Onion</li>
                <li>1 Can Campbells Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup</li>
                <li>3tbs Ketchup</li>
                <li>1tbs Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper, and a little italian seasoning to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Now here's how to get the casserole prepared</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose the right dish size. A 12×8-inch dish works perfectly here. 
                        It should be filled ¾ of the way once you are done with all the layers.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 425 F.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet, cook the beef and onion over medium-high heat until
                        the beef is fully browned. Break up the meat as it cooks. Drain off 
                        excess liquid.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the beef mixture with Campbell’s Soup,
                        ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 cup of shredded cheese. You can
                        also add veggies in this step if you’re using any.</li>
                    <li>Grease a 12×8-inch shallow baking dish with oil. Pour the beef mixture 
                        into the dish, and top with an even layer of tater tots.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Top the casserole with shredded
                        cheese and bake for 5 additional minutes until the cheese is melted. 
                        You’ll know it’s done when the tater tots are golden brown and the 
                        casserole is bubbling.</li>
                </ol>
